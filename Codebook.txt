Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The original dataset can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
 
run_analysis creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject using the files x_train.txt, y_train.txt, x_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt, features.txt and activity_labels.txt. The tidy dataset is called "tidydata.txt".

There are  180 observations of 88 variables. From the README.txt file in the original dataset, there are 30 subjects, each of whom completes six activities, making up 180 observations in the final average of means and standard devations.

The 88 variables in "tidydata.txt" are as follows:

"subject" - Volunteers 1:30 who perform the activity measured
"activity" - One of six activities
				- laying
				- sitting
				- standing 
				- walking
				- walkingdown
					- Walking downstairs
				- walkingup
					- Walking upstairs

From the original README.txt in the dataset:
"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."
